# California House Price Prediction
- This project aims to find a high-accuracy regression model for predicting house price in California.
#### Models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- SVR (Support Vector Regression)

## Concept
-   Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors that affect house prices by scatter plot, box plot and showed the correlation features using a heatmap.
-   Preprocessed data by removing null and outlier values then scaling the data.
-   Feature engineering using one-hot encoding to extract the "ocean_proximity" feature.
-   Identified the best model by comparing Linear Regression, SVR, and RandomForest.
-   RamdomforestRegressor is the best model which achieved an R-squared score of 0.84
